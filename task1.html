                <strong>Current mood: I'm so sad!</strong>
                <br>
My parents set a time for me to come home in the evenings. They expect me to be at home at 9 o'clock. I have asked them to give me a later curfew as I want to spend more time with my friends but they don't agree.
Last night, I attended a wonderful birthday party at my friend's house. The party was so great that I forgot the curfews. My parents were very upset and they kept calling me. I asked them to allow me to stay there a little bit later. However, they said that if I didn't come back home right away, they would go to my friend's house and pick me up. 
I was really embarrassed when I had to say goodbye to my friends but I had no choice. My parents were being unreasonable. It was a birthday party and they could be flexible to let me come back home later than the curfew time they set.
I wish that my parents would allow me to stay out until 10 o'clock in the evenings. How can I make my parents change their mind?
